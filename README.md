# Account Transactions
*Withdraws money from a pre-determined balance.*

## Design and Implementation
This was designed as part of a challenge to create a quick cash withdrawal function.
- Create function
- Add if/else in case user input exceeds balance

## Next
This is very basic, I'm thinking about modifying it to refer to many different "accounts" with different currencies and varying exchange rates to use for a game's resource system. Then I would add also deposit and transfer functions and enable a check on current balance of all accounts.
